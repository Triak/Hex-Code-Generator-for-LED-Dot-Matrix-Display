HEX Code Generator for 8x8 LED Dot-Matrix Display
Visual Studio 2010 - C#

Can generate code in either horizontal direction or vertical direction for the dot-pattern.

I made this little utility to generate font and patterns for my LED-Dot Matrix Display.
(using AVR and multiple Displays; some details of project can be found at http://ZaidPirwani.com)

The code in this WORKS, it is not the MOST ELEGANT SOLUTION but a quick 'n' dirty one.

This GIT will probably NOT be updated unless I HAVE REQUIREMENT to add more functionality like having support for bigger matrix pattern generation etc.
